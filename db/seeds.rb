  title: "An open source parser for GitHub Actions",
  content: "Since the beta release of GitHub Actions last October, \
  thousands of users have added workflow files to their repositories. \
  But until now, those files only work with the tools GitHub provided: \
  the Actions editor, the Actions execution platform, and the syntax \
  highlighting built into pull requests. To expand that universe, we need \
  to release the parser and the specification for the Actions workflow \
  language as open source. Today, we’re doing that.",

  title: 'Deep contextual multi-armed bandits: Deep learning for smarter A/B testing on autopilot',
  content: "The machine learning team at HubSpot recently \
    published a paper which we presented at the Uncertainty \
    in Deep Learning Workshop at the Uncertainty in Artificial \
    Intelligence conference. In this paper, we outlined how we’re \
    using machine learning to help our customers do better A/B \
      testing in HubSpot. This technology is now available in HubSpot’s \
      Lead Flows tool, and we’ll soon roll it out to many other areas \
      of the product. In this post, we’ll explain how the technology \
      works and how it will help our users accomplish A/B testing with \
      less effort and higher returns.",

  title: 'Code Reviews at Medium',
  content: 'Engineering teams have different norms and policies when\
    it comes to code reviews. It can be frustrating to join a \
    team and not know what is expected, or to operate with\
    old assumptions and discover that they are at odds with \
    a new team. In an effort to make it easier for engineers\
    who come from different companies, we wrote down some \
    of the features of our code review culture.
    Note: We use Git and Github for version control, \
    so when we’re talking about code reviews, we’re mainly talking\
    about Github pull requests. Also, we have a tool that integrates\
    Github and Slack, so many of our Github notifications come\
    through as Slack notifications.',
