  content: "Since the beta release of GitHub Actions last October, \
  thousands of users have added workflow files to their repositories. \
  But until now, those files only work with the tools GitHub provided: \
  the Actions editor, the Actions execution platform, and the syntax \
  highlighting built into pull requests. To expand that universe, we need \
  to release the parser and the specification for the Actions workflow \
  language as open source. Today, we’re doing that.",

      Lead Flows tool, and we’ll soon roll it out to many other areas \

  title: 'Code Reviews at Medium',
  content: "Engineering teams have different norms and policies when\
    it comes to code reviews. It can be frustrating to join a \
    team and not know what is expected, or to operate with\
    old assumptions and discover that they are at odds with \
    a new team. In an effort to make it easier for engineers\
    who come from different companies, we wrote down some \
    of the features of our code review culture.
    Note: We use Git and Github for version control, \
    so when we’re talking about code reviews, we’re mainly talking\
    about Github pull requests. Also, we have a tool that integrates\
    Github and Slack, so many of our Github notifications come\
    through as Slack notifications.",

  title: "HubSpot’s Engineering Values",
  content: "As our team has grown, we’ve reached a point where tribal knowledge just \
    doesn’t get transmitted as easily as it used to. For much of this \
    tribal knowledge — like why half our infrastructure team recently \
    Photoshopped lasers onto their eyes in their Slack pictures — \
    it’s not a big deal if not everyone's in on the joke. But when \
    it comes to our team’s values — the very principles that shape \
    how we work, and why — well, we want everyone to be on the inside.
    At our engineering leadership offsite last month, we realized that \
    as we scale, we need to share our engineering values — our most \
    important tribal knowledge of all — more plainly, more publicly, \
    and more often. While much of our value system gets transmitted by \
    osmosis during everyday interactions between people and teams, we \
    recognized that it was time for more explicit reinforcement and \
    articulation. If we aren’t deliberate about exposing new hires to \
    these principles early and consistently, as time goes on, we risk \
    eventually diluting (and possibly losing) these important and hard-won \
    values altogether — values that have shaped the team and the company that we are today. ",

  title: "Principles for good engineering leadership",
  content: "In our recent post about how we do engineering leadership here at HubSpot, \
    we shared our philosophy about what engineering leaders should focus on. 

    We encourage our engineering leaders to be primarily product-focused (and, to a somewhat \
    lesser degree, people-focused) rather than spending most of their time driving a \
    process or managing people. This kind of leadership stands in stark contrast to \
    the kinds of leaders who primarily care about administering and health-checking \
    teams, or are on the hook for making sure their employees did the things they were supposed to do. 
  
    But expecting our leaders to focus on both product and people isn’t \
    easy. As part of our process to expand our engineering leadership, \
    both by promoting internally and hiring externally, we wanted to identify and distill \
    the leadership qualities that we’ve found to be most effective. By focusing on \
    these seven principles, leaders can make sure they’re building healthy teams and great software.
  
    What we’ve outlined below certainly isn’t a set of explicit rules or a checklist of \
    behaviors. Rather, we’ve found success in aligning our leadership efforts towards \
    a specific style and mission, while leaving space for leaders to interpret and play \
    to their strengths.
  
    We think leaders should:
    
    1. Build trust, respect, and empathy, and use that as a base to deliver radical candor.
    We’re big on Radical Candor here at HubSpot. We believe it’s the best way to help each other \
    learn and grow. Radical candor means that you give the people you manage guidance (both \
      in praise and in criticism) directly. And you do it directly, and quickly, because you \
        care about them as people. You must deliver that guidance from a base of trust and \
        respect, because if you don’t, your praise can feel insincere and your criticism can \
        feel aggressive. 
    
    When you take the time to build that base in an authentic way, the people who work for and around \
    you are much more likely to feel like you’re a strong supporting character in their careers. \
    That support will make you considerably more likely to get your message across. 
    
    2. Foster a sense of team and mission.
    HubSpotters consistently rank their team and co-workers as their favorite thing about working \
    at HubSpot. This doesn’t happen by accident; building strong, inclusive teams with cohesive \
    social bonds takes a massive amount of forethought and work. But that forethought and work \
    is an integral part of leading a team, because having strong teams is paramount to our \
    success as a company. Evidence has shown time and time again that teams who work well \
    together are happier, more productive, and retain better.
    
    But building a strong team isn’t enough, because a team without a mission is like a sailboat \
    without a mast. Leaders should be able to instill a strong sense of mission in their \
    teams, and those missions should be feasible and compelling. A team’s mission is like \
    a north star — it can keep that team moving in the same direction, together.
    
    3. Have strong working relationships across the organization, from the tech leads and the\
     individual contributors who report to them, to the product managers and designers their reports\
      work with, to their peers & the executive team.
    As our organization becomes increasingly complex, cross-team collaboration becomes more and more \
    of a challenge. Leaders help act as the connective tissue between teams, and build relationships \
    that help them reach across organizations in order to deliver results. Good leaders \
    will have a high-level overview and a deep understanding of the work going on around \
    them so that they can connect people who need to be connected and break down silos.",
